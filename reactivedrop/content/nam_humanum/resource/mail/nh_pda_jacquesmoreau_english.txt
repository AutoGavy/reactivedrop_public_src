	"MailDate3"		"Date: 03/31/43"
	"MailSubject3"	"Subject: Florenza’s mutiny"
	"MailBody3A"	"We shouldn’t have forced Lieutenant Florenza’s hands. He’s an idealist, with principles and loyal men. And now he’s coming at me. At what might be my life’s work."
	"MailBody3B"    "I suppose one can overlook pain and suffering as long as it’s out of reach, out of sight. But one cannot possibly ignore the tortured pup crying in their own backyard. Conscience… can be such a burden. I should know, of all people."
	"MailBody3C"    "So be it. And so ends Lugdunum. In a turmoil of grieved conscience."

	"MailFrom4"     "To: Dr. Helen Moreau"
	"MailDate4"		"Date : 03/31/43"
	"MailSubject4"	"Subject: N/A"
	"MailBody4A"	"Dear Vesta, this will be my final message. To whomever finds it, here is my request for Humanity:"
	"MailBody4B"    "My name is Jacques Valery Moreau. As chief scientist of the research projects undertaken within the Lugdunum’s mission and colony, I have regulated and personally carried out experiments that were not only repulsive to professional ethics, but excruciating as well towards any type of reason or sense of morality. Whether or not I regret my actions is now irrelevant. However, I would implore the military forces who’ll come upon my message to preserve the products of this grim effort. Take them, protect them, make good use of them. So that our species may still progress in adversity, for no odyssey is complete without struggles, and no science without sacrifices."
	"MailBody4C"    "Ves ta--gHelen. My flower, my fulcrum. If there is a place after death, I fear no god will allow me to join you there."
	"MailBody4D"    "Nam Humanum."
