	"MailFrom3"     "To: Personal database"
	"MailDate3"		"Date: 05/24/42"
	"MailSubject3"	"Subject: Something else"
	"MailBody3A"	"It… speaks to me. This hive mind. Or whatever one may call this unknown entity. From now on, I will be referring to her as Vesta."
	"MailBody3B"    "The process by which she addresses herself to me feels wholly alien. It is… strange, erratic, as if a new sense is borrowed to me for split seconds only to disappear again into an abyss of silence. But from this void reaches a voice, an oddly comprehensive series of sounds that I can never recall after hearing it. It... reminds me of someone I’ve lost."
	"MailBody3C"	"I have made attempts in engaging with Vesta of my own volition. I have tried talking to her, making her understand who we are, what we are. I am aware of how ludicrous this might sound… But I asked for guidance. I want to convince her, show her that there is nothing to fear. We are but fragile, helpless shells of decaying tissue and mind… and she may or may not lead to everything we hoped for."
	"MailBody3D"    "She needs only bodies."

	"MailFrom4"     "To: Dr. Helen Moreau"
	"MailDate4"		"Date: 06/15/42"
	"MailSubject4"	"Subject: N/A"
	"MailBody4A"	"So, here I am. It would seem I am confessing to a ghost. To be perfectly honest, I am unsure how much time has passed since you fell ill. Although, the time when your flowery perfume still foamed our chemically filled laboratories does not feel so far."
	"MailBody4B"    "Where this road leads, Helen, I wonder. This mission was first and foremost about the advancement of our species, humanity as a ‘one and whole’. Then, everyone soon hoped for me to give answers to all things, the substance of which I was improvising more and more as days went by. And now, the burden of responsibility for such an exceptional discovery, lies solely on me. I, a single part of two minds, must draw answers as to the existence of a new form of life within our system... Vesta... Helen. If only you were here. You were my fulcrum, the piece that gave me balance. The voice that guided me as I walked blindly on a mind’s thread of my own sewing. But that piece got dislodged the day your eyes closed."
	"MailBody4C"	"So perhaps I fell. Yet even though you were no longer at my side, I stood up. I took matters into my own hands, the way I saw fit. When I realized that within this discovery could be contained even the tiniest chance in propelling our understanding of cancerous cells and their impact on the human physiology, I hesitated no longer. As a scientist, what calling is mine if not precisely that? Should I have renounced this unique opportunity for progress, focusing solely on menial fields of study? Entrust such a discovery to a lobby of corporate rats dressed in immaculate coats so they could, somehow, morph it into a profit so ludicrous that it’d be obnoxiously sucked dry to be sold to the masses, conceded at a price none but the wealthiest from the Cores could ever hope to spare? And for... what? So that countless others may again lose wives, husbands, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters to one of the most dreadful, intolerable diseases of our time?"
	"MailBody4D"    "No. I’ve made my choice. Let them all call me mad."
